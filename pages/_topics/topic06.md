title: "JavaScript: Functional Programming"
description: > 
    Functional programming in JavaScript emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to create predictable and maintainable code. It encourages a declarative style of programming, where the logic of computation is expressed in terms of functions rather than mutable states. This paradigm helps reduce bugs and enhances code reusability.

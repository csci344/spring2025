questions:
    - What is the difference between an interpreted and a compiled language?
    - What does it mean that JavaScript is not a "strongly typed language"?
    - What are the three different ways declare a variable? What does each declaration keyword mean? Which legacy declaration keyword should be avoided if possible?
    - Know how to write a function using arrow functions and using "traditional" function declaration syntax.
    - Know the differences between equality (==) and strict equality (===) (and use strict equality as much as possible)
    - Know the basic control structures (if/else if/else, for loops, while loops, for...of loops)
    - Remember that JavaScript can be interpreted with Node.js or by a web browser
    - Review the <a href="/spring2025/resources/programming-review">programming with JavaScript cheatsheet</a> for a review.
    - Remember that DOM objects and methods are only used in <strong>"client-side" programming</strong> (within a browser). They are not supported in Node.js
    - Be able to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically (usually through event handlers).
    - Practice targeting and changing DOM elements using the <a href="/spring2025/course-files/activities/dom-tester" target="_blank">DOM manipulation worksheet</a>
    - Please refer to the <a href="/spring2025/resources/js-concepts#working-with-the-dom" target="_blank">working with the DOM</a> section of the JavaScript cheatsheet and make sure you know how to interact with the DOM.

title: "JavaScript: Foundational Concepts"
description: > 
    JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that runs in web browsers, enabling interactivity and dynamic content. It allows developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and implement features like animations, forms, and real-time updates. This unit introduces core JavaScript concepts like variables, data types, functions, loops, and event handling. By the end of this section, you will know enough to start building simple, interactive web applications.

questions:
    - What is the difference between an interpreted and a compiled language?
    - What does it mean that JavaScript is not a "strongly typed language"?
    - What are the three different ways declare a variable? What does each declaration keyword mean? Which legacy declaration keyword should be avoided if possible?
    - Know how to write a function using arrow functions and using "traditional" function declaration syntax.
    - Know the differences between equality (==) and strict equality (===) (and use strict equality as much as possible)
    - Know the basic control structures (if/else if/else, for loops, while loops, for...of loops)
    - Remember that JavaScript can be interpreted with Node.js or by a web browser
    - Review the <a href="/spring2025/resources/programming-review">programming with JavaScript cheatsheet</a> for a review.
    - Remember that DOM objects and methods are only used in <strong>"client-side" programming</strong> (within a browser). They are not supported in Node.js
    - Be able to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically (usually through event handlers).
    - Practice targeting and changing DOM elements using the <a href="/spring2025/course-files/activities/dom-tester" target="_blank">DOM manipulation worksheet</a>
    - Please refer to the <a href="/spring2025/resources/js-concepts#working-with-the-dom" target="_blank">working with the DOM</a> section of the JavaScript cheatsheet and make sure you know how to interact with the DOM.

For Tutorial 6, you will make a UNCA Course Search interface for the Computer Science Department that works like this:

Please download the starter files below and then complete the following tasks:

## I. Implement the helper functions

### 1. Filter functions
Implement two filter functions (which should return either true or false):
* `filterClassFull`: This function will take a course object as an argument and return `true` if the course is full, and `false` if it is not.
* `filterTermMatched`: This function will take a course object as an argument and return `true` if the course "matches" the search term, and `false` if it does not.
    * Use your discretion to determine a good matching algorithm. For instance, you could return `true` if the search string matches (or partially matches) one or more of the data fields (Code, CRN, Title, one of the instructor's names, etc.).

#### Tips
1. Use some of the <a href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-string-methods/" target="_blank">JavaScript built-in string methods</a>. It also might be useful to convert everything to uppercase / lowercase. Some particularly useful methods to checkout:
    {:.compact}
    * includes()
    * toUpperCase()
    * toLowerCase()
1. The filter must conform to one of the [function signatures specified in the JavaScript language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).

```js
// Part 1.1a
const filterClassFull = course => {
    // modify this
    return true;
}

// Part 1.1b
const filterTermMatched = course => {
    // modify this
    return true;
}
```

### 2. "Data to HTML" function
Implement the `dataToHTML` function, which takes a course object as an argument and returns an HTML string that represents the course.
* See the `index.html` file to examine the structure of the HTML "card" that represents a course.

```js
// Part 1.2
const dataToHTML = course => {
    // modify this
    return `Some HTML representation of the course...`;
}
```

> #### Tips
> * Use a template literal (backticks).
> * Feel free to create some helper variables to format the string output.
> {:.compact}

## II. Implement the showData function / event handler

### Implement the showData function
To actually display relevant course "cards" to the screen, you will also need to implement a `showData` function. To do this, use the built-in **filter**, **map**, and **join** array methods -- and any relevant DOM methods -- to build the interface. Specifically, you will:


1. Use the array's built in "filter" method, which takes a filter function as an argument, to return an array of objects that match the search criteria.
    * You will make use of the  `filterClassFull` and `filterTermMatched` functions.
    * Consider chaining multiple invocations of the filter method to progressively winnow down the courses matching the search criteria.<br>For instance: `const matches = data.filter(filterClassFull).filter(filterTermMatched)`).
2. Use the array's built in "map" method to generate an array of HTML strings.
3. Use the array's built in "join" method to convert the array of strings to one large HTML string (join on the empty string or the newline character).
4. Clear out the existing courses in the DOM.
5. And finally, insert the HTML string into the DOM (suggestion: use the `insertAdjacentHTML` method).

```js
// Part 2
const showData = (searchTerm, openOnly) => {
    console.log(searchTerm, openOnly);
    console.log(data); // imported from course-data.js
    // Your code here:
    
}
```

### Attach your showData function to the button's click event
Now that you have implemented your button, don't forget to attach your event handler to the button's click event (like we've been doing in class for the past few weeks).

## III. What to Submit
When you’re done, please create a link from your homepage to your Tutorial 6 web page (see Sarah’s homepage for an example). Then, commit and push all of your edits to GitHub and, paste a link to your GitHub Repository and to your GitHub pages in the Moodle submission.

If you collaborated with someone, please list your partner’s name in the comments section.

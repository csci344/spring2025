> ### Errata & Notes
> * There were a few bugs in the integration instructions / tests, so if you downloaded the starter files before 4/23 at 10PM, please re-download the starter files (and the tests_updated directory in particular).
> * Within the views/posts.py file: please make sure that when you convert the Post objects to JSON, you pass the current_user into the to_dict() method. Example:<br><br>**`json.dumps(post.to_dict(user=self.current_user))`**<br><br>This is necessary for generating `current_user_like_id` and `current_user_bookmark_id` (which are needed for the like / bookmark functionality to work with the React client).

## 1. Introduction
In this homework assignment, you are going to lock down your system so that only logged in users can interact with it by using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This requires the following changes:

### 1. REST API Changes
* Implement two new API endpoints (`/api/token` and `/api/token/refresh`) so that third-party clients can also access your REST API.
* Lock down all of your endpoints so that they require a valid JWT.
* Deprecate the hard-coded session variable for user #12 and replace it with code that retrieves the user if from the JWT.
{:.compact}

### 2. User Interface Changes 
* Create a login form to handle authentication via JWT cookies.
* Integrate your React App into Flask, and protect it.
{:.compact}
    
## 2. Background & Relevant Concepts

### 1. Bearer Tokens (External) v. Cookies + CSRF Tokens (Internal)
You can pass JWTs between the client and the server in a variety of different ways: through cookies, through custom HTTP headers, through the request body, and/or as query parameters. 

* **External Clients:** For HW4-HW6, you created an **external client** -- located on a different server than the API -- to interact with your REST API. To do this, you passed the **JWT Bearer token** in the HTTP. In this context, you did not need the CSRF token or cookies.
* **Internal Clients:** For HW9 (this homework), you will be using an **internal client** that will be hosted within the same web app as the REST API. This allows you to take advantage of some additional security measures, namely using an http-only JWT **cookie**, and incorporating a CSRF token in the HTTP header.

### 2. External Client Workflow

External clients do not rely on cookies. Instead, they usually pass authentication information via "Bearer Tokens" passed using HTTP headers. Given this, you need to implement the following features within the REST API: 

{:.compact}
1. A way for a user to authenticate with the REST API order to receive an access and refresh token.
2. Security measures on all of your REST API endpoints that require an access token.

As you have already seen, the followint code shows how you might fetch a protected resource from an ***external*** web application (running on a separate server), using a Bearer token:

For JavaScript clients that issue requests from other servers (not one that you own):
```js
fetch("/api/posts", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });
```

For Python clients:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:5000/api/posts',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token
    }
)
print('Status Code:', response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```


### 3. Internal Client Workflow
Internal, browser-based clients can take advantage of additional security measures that aren't available to external clients. Namely http-only JWT Cookies and CSRF tokens. Specifically:

1. You will write code to generate a JWT cookie, which will sent back and forth between the browser and the server via request and response headers. 
2. The `flask-jwt-extended` library has a few convenience functions that will help you generate and set these cookies:

    {:.compact}
    * `create_access_token()` -- generates the token
    * `set_access_cookies()` -- sets the access cookies on the response header
3. Workflow:

    {:.compact}
    1. User sends username and password to the server via a login form.
    1. If the credentials are valid, the server sets the JWT tokens using cookies.
    1. Because the JWT cookies are set, the system will know who is logged in.
        * Web applications will also pass an `X-CSRF-TOKEN` as an extra security measure (see below).
    1. When the JWT access token expires, the system redirects the user to the login screen.

Then, rather than using a Bearer Token, you will not only rely on the JWT http-only server cookie, but also on an `X-CSRF-TOKEN` token, which will be included in all POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests. This token will protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Here is an example of how you might use fetch to access a protected REST Endpoint from within your UI:

```js
fetch("/api/posts", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-TOKEN': '5c4f034d-13d6-4aa2-b686-ee0add18426b'
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });
```


### 4. The Flask-JWT-Extended Library
To help you implement the JWT workflow, you will be using the `flask-jwt-extended` library, which offers some common JSON Web Token functionality that will help you. Please refer to the full documentation to get a more comprehensive explanation. Some links that we have found to be particularly helpful:

* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/#general-options" target="_blank">Configuration options</a>
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#verify-tokens-in-request" target="_blank">Verification & helper functionality</a>
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refreshing_tokens/" target="_blank">Refreshing tokens</a>


<!-- #### Cheatsheet
Below are some key pieces of functionality that will be important to you as you implement authentication:

{:.cheatsheet}
| Description | Code | Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Configuration** | |  | |
| Access Token Expiration | `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES` | defaults to 10 minutes |
| Refresh Token Expiration | `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES`| defaults to 30 days
| Secret (Salt for encryption algo) | `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | store in your .env file, not in your codebase |
| **Methods & Properties** | | | |
| Current User | `flask_jwt_extended.current_user` | property that stores a User object of the logged in user. Only works if you configure your "user_lookup_loader" (see below)|
| |  | |
| **Decorators** | | | |
| Current User function decorator | `@jwt.user_lookup_loader` | Decorator to be used to specify how the current user should be retrieved (given the identity info embedded in the token). | -->


## 3. Setup
Download hw09.zip and unzip it. 

<a class="nu-button" href="/spring2025/course-files/homework/hw09.zip">hw09.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

You should see a directory structure that looks like this:

```bash
hw09
├── decorators.py
├── lib
├── models
│   └── api_structure.py
├── requirements.txt
├── static
├── templates
├── tests_updated
└── views
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── authentication.py
    └── token.py
```

Please integrate the starter files **VERY CAREFULLY** (don't rush) as follows:

### 1. Add (new files)

| File / Folder | What is this file? |
|--|--|
| `decorators.py` | Added a [decorator](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) whose job is to redirect to the login page if no credentials are found. |
| `lib` (entire folder) | Some utilities for integrating the API with your react app. |
| `tests_updated` (entire folder) | Updated tests that incorporate authentication. |
| `views/authentication.py` | View that handles the login / logout form functionality. |
| `views/token.py` | API Endpoint that issues access / refresh token if authorized credentials are provided. |


### 2. Replace

| File / Folder | What Changed? |
|--|--|
| `models/api_structure.py` | New routes (`/login`, `/logout`, `/api/token`, and `/api/token/refresh`) added to the tester. |
| `requirements.txt` | Added new library / dependency called `Flask-JWT-Extended` |
| `static` (entire folder) | A few new helper JavaScript and CSS files. |
| `templates` (entire folder) | Now includes sample code for how to make requests with the authentication headers. |
| `views/__init__.py` | `initialize_routes` function updated to include new routes (`/login`, `/logout`, `/api/token`, and `/api/token/refresh`). |

### 3. Install dependencies
On the command line / Terminal / shell, **activate your virtual environment**. Then, install the new `Flask-JWT-Extended` dependency as follows:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Create a new environment variable
In your `.env` file, add a new environment variable for your JWT secret. You can make this secret anything you want:

`JWT_SECRET=MY_SECRET`

### 5. Run your old tests
Run your old tests (in the `tests` directory). They should all still pass). By the end of the assignment, all of the new tests (in the `tests_updated` directory) should pass.

{:#rest}
## 4. REST API Tasks

### 4.1. Modify app.py
In order to integrate JWT security measures into your app, you will have to make some modifications to `app.py`. Please complete the following 4 steps:

(1) Add the new import statements:
```py
# import statement at the top
import flask_jwt_extended                       
```

(2) Replace CORS statement:
```py
# replace CORS statement with this one:
# update:
cors = CORS(app, 
    resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": '*'}}, 
    supports_credentials=True # new
)
```

(3) Turn on the JWT Manager:
```py
# 4. Turn on the JWT Manager
app.config["JWT_SECRET_KEY"] = os.environ.get('JWT_SECRET')
app.config["JWT_TOKEN_LOCATION"] = ["headers", "cookies"]
app.config["JWT_COOKIE_SECURE"] = False
app.config['PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS'] = True 
jwt = flask_jwt_extended.JWTManager(app)
```

(4) Add the JWT user lookup convenience function (<a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/" target="_blank">https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/</a>)

```py
# Include JWT starter code for querying the DB for user info:
@jwt.user_lookup_loader
def user_lookup_callback(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
    # print('JWT data:', jwt_data)
    user_id = jwt_data["sub"]
    return User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).one_or_none()
```

### 4.2. Secure the REST API (20 Points)
After updating `app.py`, you will make the following three changes to your REST API in order to implement JWT authentication:

<table class="rubric-indent">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Method/Route</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Parameters</th>
            <th>Points</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td>POST /api/token</td>
            <td>Issues an access and refresh token if the correct credentials are posted to the endpoint.<br><br>Example (truncated for readability):
            <pre>{

    "refresh_token": "e0e.mcm.6ktQ"
}</pre>
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>username</code> (string, required): The username of the person logging in.</li>
                    <li><code>password</code> (string, required): The password of the person logging in.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td>POST /api/token/refresh</td>
            <td>
                Issues new access token if a valid refresh token is posted to the endpoint.<br><br>Example (truncated for readability):
                <pre>{
    "access_token": "e0e.Ras.i3NyZ"
}</pre>
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>refresh_token</code> (string, required): The refresh token that was previously issued to the user from the /api/token endpoint.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td>All routes</td>
            <td>
                Lockdown all endpoints (see <a href="#note">note below</a>).
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Every API endpoint in the system should now require a JWT token using the <code>@flask_jwt_extended.jwt_required()</code> decorator.</li>
                    <li>Replace <code>app.current_user</code> with <code>flask_jwt_extended.current_user</code>.</li>
                    <li>All tests should pass with the new test suite.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td></td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4.</td>
            <td>app.py</td>
            <td>
               Deprecate <code>app.current_user</code> (which is hardcoded to User #12) and use the user_id embedded in the JWT instead. 
            </td>
            <td></td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

{:#note}
#### Note on Deprecating User #12
Deprecate `app.current_user` by commenting out the following lines in `app.py`

```python
# set logged in user
with app.app_context():
    app.current_user = User.query.filter_by(id=12).one()
```

In its place, you will used a different approach suggested by the `flask-jwt-extended` library, which involves:
1. Defining a function that retrieves the User object based on the user_id that is embedded in the token.
2. Adding the `@jwt.user_lookup_loader` decorator to the top of the function. By doing this, you can use the built-in `flask_jwt_extended.current_user` property to access the logged in user (works like magic).

**Sample code:**

```python
# defines the function for retrieving a user from the database
@jwt.user_lookup_loader
def user_lookup_callback(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
    # print('JWT data:', jwt_data)
    # https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/
    user_id = jwt_data["sub"]
    return User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).one_or_none()
```

When you're done, you will replace ALL instances of `app.current_user` with `flask_jwt_extended.current_user`. 
 
* When you're done with the 4 tasks listed above all of the tests in `tests_updated` should pass (just run `run_tests.py`) EXCEPT for `test_login.py` and `test_logout.py` (you'll do that in the next step).

{:#ui}
## 5. UI Tasks
In addition to modifying the REST API Endpoints, you are also going to secure your React client by integrating it into your Flask App and creating a login screen to protect it. To do this, please complete the following tasks: 

### 5.1. Integrate Your React Client
Copy your react client folder (from HW6) into the root of your Flask app. Rename that folder to `react-client` (you can call it anything, but let's keep it consistent for simplicity).

### 5.2. Modify app.py
When you're done, make the following changes to `app.py` so that the base URL opens the React UI (if the user is logged in).

(1) Add the new import statements:
```py
# import statement at the top
from lib.flask_multistatic import MultiStaticFlask as Flask
from flask import send_from_directory            
```

(2) Tell flask which static folders it needs to be aware of:
```py
# place the following after: app = Flask(__name__)
app.static_folder = [
    os.path.join(app.root_path, 'react-client', 'build', 'static'),
    os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static')
]
```

(3) Modify the root path to point to your React App:
```py
@app.route('/')
# @decorators.jwt_or_login
def home():
    # https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-a-react-python-flask-project-on-heroku-edb99309311
    return send_from_directory(app.root_path + '/react-client/build', 'index.html')
```

### 5.3. Build Your React Client
Navigate into your `react-client` folder from the command line and compile your react application by issuing the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This should create a new directory called "build" that will house your compiled React app. When you're done, restart your flask app and navigate to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:5000</a>. You should see your react app running.

### 5.4. Secure the User Interface (15 Points)
Secure the user interface as follows:

<table class="rubric-indent">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>

            <td>
                Create an HTML login form for your app (feel free to borrow code from the Lecture 25 files) by editing the <code>templates/login.html</code> html file. The form should POST to the <code>/login</code> endpoint.

                Implement the <code>/login</code> POST endpoint by editing <code>views/authentication.py</code>.

            <td>
                Create logout endpoint (GET) by editing <code>views/authentication.py</code>. This endpoint should unset the JWT cookies and redirect the user to the <code>/login</code> page. When you're done, your <code>tests_updated/test_logout.py</code> tests should pass.

## 6. Extra Credit (10pts): Deploying to Heroku
If you plan to deploy your secured React + Flask app to Heroku, there are a few additional steps you need to complete:
* Create a `package.json` file at the root of your Flask app (note that this is in addition to the `package.json` file inside of your `react-client` directory) that has the JSON format shown below.
* The second `package.json` file at the root of your app teaches Heroku to compile your react app from within the `react-client` subdirectory.
* Ensure that your `react-client/node_modules` and `react-client/build` folders are excluded from git via your `.gitignore` file. If you don't know how to do this, ask Sarah.
* Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
* On Heroku, create one additional environment variable called `JWT_SECRET`. We recommend that you use the same secret locally and on Heroku. To add an environment variable, go to the settings tab of your app and click the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
* Deploy to Heroku (see instructions from HW7).

**package.json file at the root of your Flask app** (not the one in your `react-client` folder):
```json
{
    "name": "photo-app-heroku-react-build-file",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "scripts": {
      "build": "cd react-client && npm install && npm run build"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "cross-env": "^7.0.3"
    }
}  
```
